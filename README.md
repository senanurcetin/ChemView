# ChemView | Open Source IIoT Digital Twin HMI

ChemView is a futuristic, high-end Human-Machine Interface (HMI) for monitoring and controlling industrial chemical mixing tanks. It serves as a **high-fidelity Digital Twin Prototype**, demonstrating real-time data ingestion, animated physical simulations, and industrial safety interlocks.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is an educational prototype for building industrial control systems with modern web technologies. It simulates a **Modbus TCP/IP** environment where an operator can monitor telemetry and actively override system setpoints.

### Core Architecture
- **Physical Simulation Engine:** Deterministic polling cycle (1000ms) with thermal and rotational inertia modeling.
- **Protocol Layer:** Simulated Modbus TCP frames (RX/TX) for telemetry and state changes.
- **Safety System:** Hard-coded industrial interlocks (Valve/Mixer) to prevent operational hazards.
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, and Recharts for high-frequency time-series visualization.

## ✨ Features

- **Full Control System:** Switch between **Auto** and **Manual Override** modes.
- **Safety Interlocks:** Automated blocks that prevent valve discharge while mixing (RPM < 1 check).
- **Heating System:** Integrated thermal dynamics with visual glowing coil simulation.
- **Live Communication Log:** Real-time hex-format protocol traffic visualization (Modbus TCP/IP).
- **Trend Analysis:** Real-time charts for temperature and speed telemetry.
- **Responsive HMI:** Optimized for fixed-viewport control panels (Single Viewport layout).

## 🛠️ Getting Started
